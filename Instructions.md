## MISSION ##

Welcome to Earth Defense.  You have been tasked with the eradication of a strange alien force that has invaded our planet.  We have provided you with a state-of-the-art ship and weaponry but be warned, you only get one chance to use them.  One hit from an alien supercharged chemically infused hyper-explosive guided missile will decimate your ship and smash our last last hope of survival as a human race.
May the forks be with you!
