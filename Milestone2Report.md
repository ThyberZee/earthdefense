### Milestone 2 Report ###

The only bugs may be that the player ship does not explode or otherwise get destroyed when a bullet hits it, and at the beginning of the game it automatically moves right.  Basically the game just pauses when a collision occurs and that is it. Also, the bullets are not yet transparent, enemies come onto the screen from the bottom sometimes, and enemies are still randomly generated.

Use the arrow keys to move your ship left and right, and use the spacebar to shoot projectiles.  Destroy all resistance forces or suffer the consequences.
