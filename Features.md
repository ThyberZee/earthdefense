### Features ###
---Milestone 1---

Currently, the features in earthdefense are pretty limited.  However, It does have basic functionality, allowing users to shoot and destroy enemies that also shoot back.  Destroying an enemy increments the score by 100.  So far, that's all it does.

For the future, the main features to implement are loadable levels, highscore saving, and networked multiplayer

---Milestone 2---

All features of Milestone 1 are included, plus loadable levels, stub implementation of difficulty levels, multiplayer logic in place -- waiting on GUI to provide interface, and improved sprite design and aesthetics.

---Final Release---

All the above features plus difficulty levels, multiplayer, and Levels. All requirements of both Milestones have been met.
