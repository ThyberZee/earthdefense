## Team Yellow Project Proposal ##

Note: this proposal contains gameplay concepts that were altered over the course of the project.  Does not entirely represent the project's final form.

### Proposal ###

Our proposal is to create a multiplayer top-down arcade space shooter in the style of Galaga and 1941.  Players will be able to control a ship and combat alien vessels who will be shooting back.  When multiplayer mode is enabled, two or more players will be able to play side by side competing to see which one can get more kills than the other.

Gameplay will consist of controlling the main ship with arrow keys, and shooting with the spacebar.  The players will be at the bottom of the screen shooting enemy ships that come down from the top.    The game will be played in several levels;  defeating all the enemies in one level will load up the next, with difficulty escalating level by level.  The player’s score will be increase for every enemy ship destroyed, with stronger enemies generating greater scores.  In single-player mode, the player will just be competing against previous high scores;  however, in multiplayer mode, players will compete against each other’s scores. In single-player mode, player will be able to save their progress and return later to continue where they left off.  The player start off with multiple lives.  Every time the player gets shot or hit by an enemy ship, he will lose a life.  When the player loses all his lives or all the levels are completed, the final high score is calculated and stored, and the game is restarted.
