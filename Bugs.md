### Explosion Animation Bug ###
Sometimes the explosion animation shows up on the "Save Game" and "Start Over" buttons on the top of the InGame screen.  They also sometimes show up on the bullets themselves right when they're fired and stay with the bullet all the way up the screen.

### Sprite Persistence Bug ###
Occasionally, when an entity is destroyed in multiplayer, the corresponding sprite doesn't disappear from the client, but just freezes where it is.  This doesn't affect gameplay, but is kind of jarring for user experience.

### Level Syncing Bug ###
The Client of a multiplayer game doesn't display the current level, but is always set to zero.

### Start Over Player Widget Bug ###
When the Start Over button is clicked in game, the previous player widget does not disappear from the screen.
